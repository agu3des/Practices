## Developing in Java
- `Annotations`: https://ananda-guedes.notion.site/Java-7bd2e647b3a44bcdbb6b3c05132b71a6?pvs=4
- `Course`: https://loiane.training/curso/java-basico

## Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.


## Dependency Management
The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
